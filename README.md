#rita

rita is a [dsebaseapp](https://github.com/KONDE-AT/dsebaseapp] based web application to publish XML/TEI encoded transcripts of inventories from 18th century Tyrol.
Transcriptions and application were created in the context of the FWF funded project ["Reading in the Alps"](https://pf.fwf.ac.at/de/wissenschaft-konkret/project-finder?search[what]=P+29329).
